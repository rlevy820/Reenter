# Reenter

A terminal-based tool that helps you re-engage with old projects. Like having a senior dev sit next to you, read through your old code, and get you moving again — without touching anything you didn't approve.

## The Problem

You build something cool. You understand it completely while you're in it. You put it down. Years later you open it and have no idea what's going on — not because you're not capable, but because the momentum is gone.

## What It Does

Point Reenter at an old project. It reads it, tells you in plain english what it is and what it runs on, then asks you one question:

**What do you want to do with it?**

Your answer shapes everything that follows.

## Three Modes

1. **Just run it** — what would it take to get this running locally right now
2. **Get back in** — reconstruct enough context to start developing again
3. **Refactor and clean it up** — restructure for readability and future building, without changing what it does

## Core Principles

- **Deterministic flow** — every question has a purpose, every answer leads somewhere specific
- **LLM powered** — intelligent enough to read any project type, any language, any structure
- **One thing at a time** — never overwhelming, always a clear next step
- **Plain english** — speaks to a technical but self-taught builder, not a computer science textbook
- **Read before touch** — never changes anything without explicit approval
